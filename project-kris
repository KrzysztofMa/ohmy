<h2 style="text-align: center; color: #333299;"><strong>Testing new project – curiosities:</strong></h2>
<ul style="text-align: center;">
 	<li>here should be outlined the first essential point</li>
 	<li>Hillenburg came up with the idea that his main character will look like a kitchen sponge while doing dishes.</li>
 	<li>The cartoon was screened in 136 countries and it gained millions of fans among children, teenagers, and even adults. It is also a record production of Nickelodeon in terms of the number of produced episodes (more than 200).</li>
 	<li>In honor of SpongeBob his name was given to recently discovered species of fungi. Named Spongiforma squarepantsii. The scientist came up with the idea to give this name because fungi looks more like a sponge sea than a mushroom.</li>
 	<li>Initially, the main character was to be named SpongeBoy. However, this name was already in use by the producer of mops. Eventually, the creator made up the very similar name and so it stayed until now.</li>
 	<li>Many celebrities visited Bikini Bottom as guest roles. You could already see there Pink, Will Ferrell, Johnny Depp, and Robin Williams.</li>
 	<li>The very first SpongeBob coloring pages appeared on a market in 1999. It's hard to believe that they were popular among children for so many years.</li>
</ul>
